            <h2>Racing Bikes</h2>
            <p>The racing bike has been designed so as to travel on paved roads. Its light weight and
                aerodynamics allow the rider to get to and keep very high speeds and are its most important features.
            </p>
            <p>As they are generally intended for athletes and competitors, racing bikes have a very large number of
                gears
                which require the rider have a good basic training for climbing steep hills.
            </p>
            <p>The racing bike is not suitable for cycling tourists or for those who like travelling by bike: in fact,
                the
                racing bike is not designed to have a rack and it’s not very comfortable because of its handlebars,
                aerodynamic position and very rigid frame.</p>

            <p>That said, the racing bike is so fascinating that it’s considered to be the most beloved bike model and a
                very good companion for your adventures (with some small modifications!) for all of our trips.
            </p>
            <p>Now we’re going to deal with the various parts of a racing bicycle and give you some advice to make this
                model suitable for your cycling trips.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3> Bicycle Frame </h3>
            <p>The frame is the bike’s framework and must be right for each person to have a good position on the
                saddle.
                The fork height, which is the distance from the sole of the foot to the crotch, is the right measure for
                the frame.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately measures are not standard, so you’ll find measurements in centimeters, inches or with the
                words Small, Medium, Large, ExtraLarge. The table below will show you the frame suitable for you in the
                three kinds of measurements.</p>

            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>fork height</th>
                    <th>frame cm</th>
                    <th>frame inches</th>
                    <th>size</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>75-78 cm</td>
                    <td>48-51</td>
                    <td>14-16</td>
                    <td>S</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>79-82 cm</td>
                    <td>50-54</td>
                    <td>16-17</td>
                    <td>M</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>83-86 cm</td>
                    <td>53-57</td>
                    <td>17-18</td>
                    <td>L</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>87-90 cm</td>
                    <td>56-60</td>
                    <td>19-21</td>
                    <td>XL</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <p>The frame is the part that most influences your position on the saddle and can consequently cause
                muscular pain (particularly neck and back pain) when it’s not the right measure.</p>

            <p>The racing bike was born to address the needs of professional cyclists. It led bicycle manufacturing
                companies to search for more and more aerodynamic, strong and light materials and models. The main
                materials used for frames are:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Carbon: this is a very light material used in high level bicycles. It guarantees very good
                    performance, especially uphill.</li>
                <li>Aluminium: this is a mid-level material, but it’s stronger and less expensive than carbon. It’s
                    mounted in most mid level bikes.</li>
                <li>Steel: it’s the heaviest and the least used material these days.</li>
            </ol>
            <hr>
            <h3> Racing Bike Wheels</h3>
            <p>
                The wheel of a racing bike is composed of a hub, rim, an inner tube and a tire.</p>

            <p>The hub is the central part of a wheel and allows both for its rotation and the tension of the spokes.
            </p>

            <p>The rims are the main part of a wheel: they are made of aluminium and must guarantee balance, lightness
                and good aerodynamics. Profile and diameter are their main characteristics. There are low, mid or high
                profile rims according to the rim height.</p>

            <p>Low profile rims are 2 cm high and are the most common thanks to their lightness and elasticity that
                make vibrations cushioned. Unfortunately they aren’t very strong and tend to lose their shape easily ,
                so that it’s very important to be very careful in the tension of the spokes.</p>

            <p>High profile rims are about 5-6 cm high and were born to reduce air flow and guarantee more balance and
                aerodynamics when you pedal. Their main characteristics are strength (this makes it possible to reduce
                considerably the number of the spokes) and aerodynamics. On the other hand, the bigger weight and the
                lack of elasticity (that prevents vibrations softening) make every turn of the pedals rather
                uncomfortable.</p>

            <p>To this day mid profile rims are the most used ones because they are a good compromise for strenghth,
                stiffness, comfort and aerodynamics. They are 3 cm high, so the weight turns out to be not too big, the
                stiffness is adequate and comfort is quite good in the strokes of pedal.</p>

            <p>Racing bikes have a standard 28 inch diameter rim.</p>

            <p>The function of the spokes is both to keep a constant and fluid rotation of the rim and support and
                soften the rider’s weight and the stresses coming from the ground. There’s not a standard number of
                spokes used and the idea is to get to the right balance between lightness and stability of the bike: in
                fact, too many spokes would make the bike very heavy and subjected to stresses, too few spokes would
                make the rim weak and vibrations excessive.</p>

            <p>In racing bikes, the spokes mounted on the rear wheel are more than the ones on the front wheel . For
                example, amateur bikes may have 18 front spokes and 20 rear ones, while professional bikes have 22 front
                and 24 rear.</p>

            <h4>Bicycle tires and Inner Tube:</h4>
            Due to the need to have a weak friction with the ground, racing bikes have very thin, smooth tires which
            are kept inflated at high pressure.

            <p>tires are of various sizes according to the section. Professional racing bikes have 19-20 mm wide tires.
            </p>

            <p>We would like to advise all those people who are going to practice cycling as tourists to mount much
                wider tires on their bikes because the lower speed due to friction is counterbalanced by fewer punctures
                and greater comfort. Our advice is to mount at least 23 mm tires ( even better would be 26-28).</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Bicycle Brakes</h3>
            <p>Calliper brakes are still the most common ones in racing bikes: it’s a very simple model made of two
                alloy arms that cross at a pivot: when they’re operated they close and cause braking through the
                friction of the brake shoes on the braking path of the rim.</p>

            <p>A good braking modulation is very important for your safety this is why you don’t need to pull the
                brake levers completely to stop your bike.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Derailleur Gear</h3>
            <p>This is the basic mechanical part in racing bicycles and allows the rider to change the strength and
                hardness of the turns of the pedals. It consists of starting levers, front and rear derailleurs,
                sprockets and chainrings.</p>
            <p>In modern racing bikes, the gear levers are situated next to the brake levers and are connected to the
                derailleur via a cable. When these levers are operated the derailleur works and moves the chain on the
                various sprockets and chainrings. The number of teeth composing the cogset and the front and rear
                chainrings is the unit of measurement.</p>

            <p>The ratio between the number of teeth of the front gear wheel and the one of the rear sprocket
                multiplied by the circumference of the wheel allows us to obtain the metric development of the gear
                used.</p>

            <p>High gears allow the rider to cover a good distance with every rotation of the pedals but require more
                effort, therefore it’s better for a cyclist to use them on a flat road; low gears allow easier pedalling
                and are used for cycling uphill.</p>

            <p>The main thing in choosing the model of a racing bicycle to purchase is to take into account the right
                combination of gears.</p>

            <p>As mentioned, the racing bike was designed to guarantee high performance: in mass production very high
                gears are mounted (2 chainrings, a 52-53 teeth big one and a 39-41 teeth small one, and 10 rear
                sprockets ranging from 11 to 27 teeth). We obviously advise those who like cycling as tourists to buy a
                bike with easier gears.</p>

            <p>Nowadays there are racing bikes with a third smaller chainring ( for ex. 30 teeth) mounted in addition
                to the two standard chainrings so as to offer a complete range of gears; in this way you are able to
                travel on flat roads at your best and climb steep hills with the least effort.</p>

            <p>On bikes designed with two chainrings, it’s very complicated to add a further one but in this case the
                best thing is to mount a ‘ compact’ set of chainrings. In this way the chainrings are only two but have
                a much smaller size than the standard 52-41 and it allows the rider to climb steep hills at the best.
                Compact chainrings are 48-50/34-36 sized.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Bicycle Saddle</h3>
            <p>Starting with the old leather saddles a lot of improvements have been made in the matter of models,
                shapes and materials for saddles of any kind and any request.</p>

            <p>The primary features are obviously seat comfort and slimness in order not to disturb pedalling and not
                to cause friction to the thighs.</p>

            <p>Recent models have a hole in the central part so as to reduce the pressure of the perineum and avoid the
                crushing of the prostate.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Handlebars</h3>
            <p>The typical curve of racing bikes handlebars allows you a highly aerodynamic position with the least air
                friction. It’s not a very comfortable position, especially for a long time.</p>

            <p>Many modern bikes get past this problem via a second set of brakes on the flat part of the handlebar. In
                this way you’ll be able to keep a less aerodynamic but more comfortable upright position and to brake at
                any moment.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Pedals</h3>
            <p>In racing bikes the pedals are arranged to attach to the sole of the shoe. This allows the rider to take
                advantage of the strength of pedalling.</p>

            <p>There are two main models: the most used model up till today is the “look” one, that has a wide base and
                allows a very good push but doesn’t permit the rider to walk easily.</p>

            <p>We advise cycling tourists to use the so called “spd” attachment. It was originally mounted on mountain
                bikes and allows for both a sure and efficient attachment and easy walking , when you get off your bike,
                thanks to the cleat which is entirely set inside the sole of the shoe.</p>

            <h2>Mountain Bikes</h2>
            <p>The mountain bike was born in California at the end of the sixties: it was designed to travel on unpaved
                roads and paths both uphill and downhill.</p>

            <p>Handiness, toughness and agility are the main characteristics an MTB should have.</p>

            <p>Handiness, toughness and the necessity to travel on unpaved roads require a heavier frame; tires with a
                wider diameter than a road bike are required, too, so as to increase friction between tires and terrain
                and to reduce performance on paved roads. All the same, cycling tourists like MTBs a lot because they
                are safe on any kinds of terrain and steady enough to be fit to luggage transportation.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Frame</h3>
            <p>It’s the central and main part of a bike and the main point to get performance, comfort and usability;
                it obviously weighs on the final price.</p>

            <p>An MTB frame has a different shape from the usual road bike frame in order to meet requirements of
                handiness and toughness. As a matter of fact, these MTB frames are more compact, less stretched out and
                much stronger.</p>

            <p>These frames are mainly required to withstand the power of pedalling, discharge it on the rear wheel and
                withstand the stresses of off-road paths. If you want to purchase an MTB you should take rigidity,
                elasticity and weight of the frame into account: rigidity conveys pedalling energy to the rear wheel;
                elasticity helps your bike to withstand stresses and to fit to the various terrains; weight bears on the
                transportation of your bike.</p>

            <p>This is why bike designers have used all those new materials which combine lightness, rigidity and
                elasticity.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Materials</h3>
            <p>Until some years ago steel was the most used material as it is heavy enough and guarantees very good
                toughness and durability. But nowadays steel has been replaced with aluminium in mass production: as a
                matter of fact, 90% mountain bike frames are made of this material that is a good compromise between
                rigidity and weight.</p>

            <p>Steel is still used in some low cost MTBs and in models with a very high cost and performance: steel
                frames with a similar weight as aluminium ones are produced by using special alloys and skilled labour;
                moreover they maintain elasticity and toughness which are the main features of steel.</p>

            <p>Carbon: this is a very expensive material and is mostly mounted on bikes used in cross country
                competitions. It’s lighter and more flexible than aluminium but is also less strong and much more
                subjected to wear and tear.</p>

            <p>Titanium: this is the top of the line material indeed as it represents the best compromise among
                strength, lightness and elasticity. Unfortunately it has a very high price, so this is why it’s not very
                common and it’s only mounted on very high level bikes.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Types of Mountain Bikes</h3>
            <p>There are various types of mountain bikes; so, when you mean to purchase an MTB, you should realize the
                real differences among these kinds and how you want to use it.</p>

            <h4>FULLY RIGID BIKE</h4>

            <p>This is the basic model, with no suspension.
                It’s not demanded very much because of the development and the reduction in prices of the bikes with
                suspension.</p>

            <p>But we think that this model is often undervalued, as rigid MTBs are cheap and provide good performance
                thanks to their stability and to their easier control while in motion, especially if you want to carry
                some luggage. This is good unless you mean to use your bike for cross country racing or for very uneven
                pathways.</p>

            <h4>FRONT SUSPENDED/HARDTAIL</h4>

            <p>This type of bike has got a front suspension often implemented with a set of shock absorbers in the
                front fork and has about 80 to 100 mm of suspension travel.</p>

            <p>Nowadays it’s the most common model and it’s also used in professional races with not too difficult
                circuits; moreover these bikes are lighter and easier to ride than the full suspended ones.</p>

            <h4>FULL SUSPENDED/SOFTAIL BIKES</h4>

            <p>They have front and rear suspension and have been designed in order to guarantee to absorb shocks almost
                completely on very hard pathways, mostly downhill.</p>

            <p>The double shock absorber makes these bikes very heavy; this is why designers tend to use more and more
                technological and light materials: unfortunately this weighs on the cost that’s really very high</p>
        </span>
        <span id="cbi">
            <h2>City Bikes</h2>
            <p>The hybrid bicycle (also called touring bike, trekking bike or city bike) has only recently come on the
                market and is very similar to a racing bicycle.
                city bikeThe main differences are angled-back handlebars, a stronger frame and a triple front crank.
                tires are 700 sized but have a slightly wider diameter.
                A lot of cycling tourists like hybrid bikes best because they allow the riders to carry some luggage and
                are
                more comfortable than other kinds of bikes if you have to travel long distances.</p>

            <p>Moreover, the triple crank is very good to climb uphill and makes you recover when you are tired.</p>

            <h3>Features coming from Mountain Bikes:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>a comfortable riding posture</li>
                <li>a frame able to cushion weight</li>
                <li>wider tires so as to have greater balance</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Features coming from Racing Bikes:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>lighter rims for the purpose of a faster pace</li>
                <li>lighter components equipped with speed ratios</li>
            </ul>
            <hr>
            <h3>Wheels</h3>
            <p>The wheels of hybrid bikes have the characteristics both of the mountain and the racing bikes. A wider
                diameter provides greater and long-lasting balance and the higher pressure is the same as racing bikes.
                Rims and spokes are light because this type of wheel isn’t likely to be used on unpaved road.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Frame</h3>
            <p>Most hybrid bikes are made of steel or light aluminium because of the durability and the low price of
                these materials.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Handlebars</h3>
            <p>The handlebars of hybrid bikes are as flat as the ones of mountain bikes. They allow the rider an upright
                posture so as to have a better vision and a better check of his bike.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Gears</h3>
            <p>Hybrid bikes have got a wide range of gears which enable the rider both to climb uphill and to travel
                along flat roads. This type of bike has usually got from 16 to 27 gears.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Pedals</h3>
            <p>
                Pedals mounted on this bike are generally standard and without attachments. As these bikes are designed
                for rides through relatively flat urban areas or for cycling tourists, one can easily get on/off them.
                If you mount clipless pedals it’ll give more power to pedalling.</p>

            <p>You can purchase a good quality model starting from 400-500 € by now; there are also step-through frame
                bicycles with a low crossbar which are suitable for women.

            <h2>Bike Maintainace</h2>
            <p>
                A basic knowledge about how to repair and take care of your bike is very useful for the purpose of your
                safety and to help you in working out any trouble that might occur during your trips.
                The maintenance of your bike, the cleaning of its mechanical parts, checking and cleaning its frame,
                brakes and derailleur gear are useful not only to make your bicycle clean but more importantly safe and
                functioning.</p>

            <p>A person really fond of cycling should be able to repair almost any piece of his/her bike: he/she should
                know how to change the brakes cable, the derailleur gear cable, to adjust gears, to change the chain
                etc.</p>

            <p>In any regard, a bicycle is a delicate machine and some repairs may make the situation worse than before
                if we aren’t skilled. Therefore we advise you to acquire the minimal skills so as to work the most
                common troubles out and to understand by preventive maintenance when it’s time to take your bike to the
                mechanic’s.</p>

            <p>A good preventive maintenance starts from the cleaning of your bike, that helps not only to make your
                bicycle cleaner but also to assure more efficiency of the pedal rotations and the derailleur gear in
                particular.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Bike Cleaning</h3>
            <p>Naphtha and brush: cleaning a bike starts from removing dust and dirt from the mechanical parts; a brush
                and a can of naphtha are enough for a very good cleaning of the mechanical parts of your bike.</p>

            <p>Firstly pass the brush soaked in naphtha through the chain so as to remove dirt and sludge . Turn the
                pedals so that naphtha can pass all over the chain and inside the links, then clean the other parts like
                brakes and pedals, but have a special care of the derailleur gears.</p>

            <p>Sponge and soap: after using naphtha, you have to remove dirt and grease. If you’ve got it, you should
                use a garden hose to wash your bike quickly, otherwise use sponge and soap immediately! Don’t be afraid
                of making use of water and soap ( car shampoo will fit, too), because there’s no chance of damaging the
                frame or the mechanical parts of your bike.</p>

            <p>Now it’s time to lubricate your bike and go! Once your bike’s dry, the last but not least step is the
                lubrication of the chain: at this time you’re really ready to go and ride your bike, shiny,
                in-perfect-working-condition!</p>
            <h3>Preventive Maintainace</h3>
            <p>Once your bicycle is clean it’s worthwhile to perform an inspection so as to detect incipient failures.
                It will allow you to prevent disagreeable troubles and will make your trips safer.</p>

            <h4>Handlebars</h4>
            <p>While stopping the front wheel of your bike between your legs, see that the handlebar is perfectly
                symmetrical with respect to both the frame and the wheel and make sure that there’s no rotational
                movement. If the stopped handlebar moves, the bolts linking to the frame must be screwed tighter.</p>
            <h4>Brakes</h4>
            <p>See that they are well tightened so to have good braking, because brakes are of primary importance for
                your safety. Operate the levers of the brakes and try to push your bike: it should stop immediately,
                before the levers touch the handlebars.</p>
            <h4>Derailleur Gear</h4>
            <p>Lift the rear wheel up, turn the pedals and try to shift the various gears which should work without
                tension or strange noises. In case of failure, try to lubricate the mechanical parts of the derailleurs;
                otherwise, take your bike to the mechanic’s.</p>
            <h4>Tires</h4>
            <p>In racing bikes tires are generally very thin, so the risk of a puncture is high. Anyhow a special care
                of tires will help you to have a remarkable reduction of this risk.</p>

            <p>Turn both the front and the rear wheel of the bike and see that there aren’t any bulges, scratches or
                small cuts. In this case change the tire to prevent a very likely puncture. Any way take a spare tube
                and all tools necessary for repairing a puncture with you.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Wheels: How to Change the Inner Tubes</h3>
            <p>It’s a very simple operation: first remove the tire by the special keys, then take the inner tube out and
                mount the new one starting from the valve.</p>
            <p>You should inspect the tire before mounting the new inner tube so as to carry possible nails, pins or any
                cause of punctures away. Before closing the tire, inflate the inner tube slightly in order to avoid
                “pinches” while closing.</p>
            <p>At the beginning it will seem to be very soft, so you can simply use only your hands, but it will be more
                and more difficult going on without the specific keys. In this last step be very careful to avoid
                pinches when you use the key, otherwise you’re going to have a flat tire again even without riding your
                bicycle at all. </p>

            <h2>Bike Accessories</h2>
            <p>Cycling, like any special field, allows you to spend a lot of money.
                As there are newer and newer products and gadgets brought out every day and each of them seems to be
                unique and necessary, you should pay a lot of attention and choose carefully anything you really
                need.Now we are going to list some bike accessories we think to be really useful to a rider and mostly
                to a cycling tourist:</p>
            <hr>
            <p>Helmet: it’s undoubtedly the main accessory for cycling. The latest models are very light and very well
                ventilated so as to be comfortable and loose-fitting, but it’s necessary to purchase the right size and
                wear it in the correct way.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>Lights: this is another, necessary accessory for your safety. If you occasionally ride at night, mount a
                front light so as to illuminate the way forward and a rear flashlight so as to be seen by cars. </p>
            <hr>
            <p>Gloves: it’s an important accessory both in winter and in summer. Gloves keep your hands warm in winter,
                make the grip on handlebars safer, protect your hands if you fall and damp down road shocks transmitted
                by handlebars (provided they are good quality gloves!)</p>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Sports glasses: they are accessories aimed at protection, too. They protect eyes from wind and dust and
                are a very good means to avoid debris and scratches coming from blackberry bushes and branches while on
                off-road pathways.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <p>Cycling shoes: shoes with attachments are a very good accessory if you want to transfer pedalling power
                to the rear wheel. There are two main kinds:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>cycling shoes with “Look” attachments guarantee very good performance but make them unsuitable for
                    walking</li>
                <li>cycling shoes with Spd attachments are the best compromise between performance and comfort. The
                    latter shoes have much smaller attachments than the “look” ones and a recessed cleat inside the sole
                    which allows the cyclist both to achieve good performance and to be enabled to get off the bike and
                    walk a short way easily enough.</li>
            </ol>
            <hr>
            <p>Water bottles, water carriers and drinking accessories: the water bottle is almost a symbol for cyclists
                and is a necessary accessory for all those who practice this sport.
                In addition to usual plastic water bottles (very cheap indeed but tending to heat drinks in summer and
                cool them in winter) there are aluminium water bottles with a special insulation that makes them
                suitable to keep the temperature of drinks. </p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Other accessories</h3>
            <p>Cyclocomputer: on the market there are a lot of cyclocomputers of any kinds, costs and performance
                measurements.
                Even basic models you can find in any cycling shop at very low prices will show you the total and
                partial distance travelled, the average and maximum speed and the current training time.</p>

            <p>Some very expensive and advanced models may also display the average altimetric trip, altitude, heart
                rate, pedalling cadence and even GPS navigation. </p>
            <hr>
            <p>Heart rate monitor: this is probably the most common and useful cycling accessory in order to check and
                arrange your own training.
                Basic models have a chest strap transmitter and a receiver which can be either a wrist watch or a
                cyclocomputer.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>Repair tool kits: both in daily and longer trips some accessories are absolutely necessary , such as an
                inner tube, a set of tyre levers, a pump, some adjustable spanners and Allen wrenches in order to set
                handlebars and saddle.</p>
